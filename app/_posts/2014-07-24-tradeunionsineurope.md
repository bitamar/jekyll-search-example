The European Trade Union Confederation  was set up in 1973 to promote the interests of working people at the European
level and to represent them in the European Union  as the only representative cross-sectoral trade union organization at the
European level.

Some countries, such as Germany  , have strong, centralized unions, where every type of industry has a specific
union, which are then gathered in large national union confederations. The
largest union confederation in Europe is the German Confederation of Trade Unions
 . Usually there are at least two national union confederations, one for
academically educated and one for branches with lower education level. The
largest Swedish union confederation  (Landsorganisationen , or LO). The LO has about 1.5 million members (including pensioners), which is
a sixth of Sweden's population (Swedish blue-collar density in 2000 was 83% and
in 2012 67%; the total density of blue-collar + white-collar employees in 2012
was 70%). Finland's equivalent is the Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions
 , with about one million members out of the country's 5.2 million inhabitants.
In addition, there are two other Finnish union confederations for more educated
workers, with combined membership of approximately one million.

In comparison, France  has one of the lowest union densities in Europe, with only about 10% of the
workers belonging to unions. Generally, several unions are represented inside
large companies or administrations, normally with one from each of the main
national confederation of unions and possibly independent unions. Union
membership, however, tends to be concentrated in some specific areas, especially
the public sector. Unions in some sectors, such as public transportation (e.g. SNCF  ), are likely to enter well-publicized strikes.
